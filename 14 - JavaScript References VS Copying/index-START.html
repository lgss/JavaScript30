    let string1 = "Hello";
    let string2 = string1;
    console.log(string1, string2);
    string1 = 'HELLO'
    console.log(string1, string2);
    string2 = 'WORLD'
    console.log(string1, string2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    let players2 = players;
    console.log(players2);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    players2[0] = 'Stuart';
    console.log(players);
    console.log(players2);

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    
    let players3 = players.slice()          //Should work with NodeLists too
    let players4 = Array.from(players);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    
    let players5 = [].concat(players);      //I don't like this...

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    let players6 = [...players];            //Works well but feels dirtier

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    const person2 = person;

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    const person3 = Object.assign({}, person, { number:99, age:100 });

    console.clear();

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    function DeepClone(obj) {
      let newObj = Object.assign({} , obj, {})
      for ( var key in newObj ) {
        newObj[key] === Object(newObj[key]) ? newObj[key] = DeepClone(obj[key]) : null
      }
      return newObj
    }

      title: 'The Colour of Magic',
      author: {
